This is a version of the GithubExplorer project written natively for iOS in Swift.

- Minimal 3rd party dependencies
- Visual tools for UI layout, quick prototypes without writing code
- Great debugging & performance profiling tools
- Great community support & StackOverflow

####Cons
- Code signing and submission process could be easier, but this is also required for a ReactNative app ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

*The project does include a homemade networking library, and a commonly used utility for managing Keychain access which would rarely change or need to be updated. These are pretty common one time setups for an iOS app.

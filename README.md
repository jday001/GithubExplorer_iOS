- Minimal 3rd party dependencies
- Visual tools for UI layout, quick prototypes without writing code
- Great debugging & performance profiling tools
- Great community support & StackOverflow

#### Cons
- Code signing and submission process could be easier, but this is also required for a ReactNative app ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

*The project does include a homemade networking library, [RemoteDataRequestor](https://github.com/jdayCBRE/GithubExplorer_iOS/blob/master/GithubExplorer_iOS/util/RemoteDataRequestor.swift), and a commonly used utility for managing Keychain access, [KeychainSwift](https://github.com/jdayCBRE/GithubExplorer_iOS/blob/master/GithubExplorer_iOS/util/KeychainSwift.swift), which would rarely change or need to be updated. These are pretty common one time setups for an iOS app.
